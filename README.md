**Tic-tac-toe** is a game where two players take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

In this project, you'll build a complete Tic Tac Toe game.


- Two players are able to play the game. One chooses X or O.
- The game recognizes three game ends: winning, losing, and drawing.
- Players choose a username before playing. 
  - Two players can pick the same username.
  - Username is a 3 to 12 characters long string.
  - It can't start with a number and can't contain special characters except the dash '-'.
  - Samples of valid usernames are: kibo, victor-d12, spiderman
- Game history (counts of wins and losses per player) must be stored in a file, 
    and there is an option to display them before we start any game.
